                    <h2>Some myths about suicide</h2>
                    <p> <strong><em>Myth:</em></strong> Talking about suicide will give a young person the idea, or permission, to
                        consider suicide
                        as a solution to their problems.
                        <strong><em>Reality:</em></strong> Talking calmly about suicide, without showing fear or making judgments, can
                        bring relief to someone who is feeling terribly isolated. A willingness to listen shows sincere concern;
                        encouraging someone to speak about their suicidal feelings can reduce the risk of an attempt.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong> Suicide is sudden and unpredictable.
                        <strong><em>Reality:</em></strong> Suicide is most often a process, not an event. Eight out of ten people who die
                        by suicide
                        gave some, or even many, indications of their intentions.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong> Suicidal youth are only seeking attention or trying to manipulate others.
                        <strong><em>Reality:</em></strong> Efforts to manipulate or grab attention are always a cause for concern. It is
                        difficult to
                        determine if a youth is at risk of suicide All suicide threats must be taken seriously.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong> Suicidal people are determined to die.
                        <strong><em>Reality:</em></strong> Suicidal youth are in pain. They don’t necessarily want to die; they want
                        their pain to
                        end. If their ability to cope is stretched to the limit, or if problems occur together with a
                        mental
                        illness, it can seem that death is the only way to make the pain stop.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong> A suicidal person will always be at risk.
                        <strong><em>Reality:</em></strong> Most people feel suicidal at some time in their lives. The overwhelming desire
                        to escape
                        from pain can be relieved when the problem or pressure is relieved. Learning effective coping
                        techniques to deal with stressful situations can help.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                    <p>This topic has a lot of ground to cover and its sensitivity can be a limiting factor for a deep
                        dive into it, or to even start to completely understand it. The data on suicides is deficient
                        because of its reliability on how suicide-like deaths are registered in some countries (for
                        example, suicides are illegal in some countries and there’s a legal incentive not to report them
                        as such). There are problems with the accuracy of official figures made available to World
                        Health Organization (WHO.) This cause of death is sometimes hidden and underreported for
                        different reasons.
                    </p>

                    <p>For starters it is not as simple as if someone took their own life or not. Deaths can be
                        categorized as suicide ideation, premeditated, or attempts..</p>

                    <p>These individual fields depend on the methods, reasons, intention, economic issues, mental
                        disorders, substance abuse, education, country, among a lot of factors. Specifically, in Mexico
                        it is shown that the rates have grown in the last 8 years. What has also increased is the
                        unemployment and obesity rates in adults and children. These sectors along with the impact of
                        social media, beauty and work stereotypes, etc can have an impact in suicide trends.</p>
